\section{Introductory Note}

A CRM, short for Customer Relationship Management, is a business strategy that leverages data analysis of customer behavior to manage and improve its relations. By gaining insights into the customer preferences and needs, a CRM system helps organizations/businesses develop and maintain strong, healthy and long relationships with their customers.

In the scope of this course, we were asked to understand, examine, and select an Open Source CRM system that can be integrated in the University of Aveiro.

For that, the Problem Based Learning (PBL) strategy was used, which is a method that focuses on self-learning techniques and allows the student to find solutions by himself. With that in mind, the group studied the advantages and characteristics of a CRM and the context of its use inside the University of Aveiro, so that we could understand its needs and select a suitable CRM system that can be integrated inside the university.

To achieve this goal, we adopted the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) strategy, a self-learning approach that encourages students to seek out solutions independently. Our group utilized this method to understand the benefits and features of a CRM system, as well as its possible usage within the University of Aveiro. By doing so, we gained an understanding of the university's requirements, and with that, we were able to identify an appropriate CRM solution for it.


\section{Application Context of the University of Aveiro}

\subsection{University of Aveiro}

The University of Aveiro has multiple data sources spread among different platforms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item SIGACAD - Academic Management System
    \item SIGEF - Financial Management System
    \item RHumo - Integrated Human Resources Management System
    \item PACO - Academic Portal
    \item RIA - Institutional Repository
    \item etc.
\end{itemize}

With that in mind, the challenge is to carefully choose an open-source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to consolidate and organize all the disparate platforms.

\subsection{Application of a CRM in this context}

Students frequently need to utilize these platforms to address various issues or challenges that they may be facing. For instance, a student may require adjustments to their tuition fees due to part-time work commitments, resulting in an inability to attend all classes. In such cases, the student must first modify their academic plan and subsequently adjust their payment plan. This can prove to be a confusing and difficult task, as it needs the use of multiple platforms, and most of the time, other services remain unaware of the student's current situation.

This is a brief example of a scenario that demands the use of multiple services, which could be streamlined and enhanced significantly through the implementation of a CRM system. A well-implemented CRM system would enable the University of Aveiro to efficiently manage the students' situations and promptly address their needs.


\section{Structural Features of a CRM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Contact management: A CRM tool should be able to store and manage all the contact information of an organization's customers (email addresses, phone numbers, etc).

    \item Customization: A CRM tool should be customizable to meet the specific needs and workflows of an organization, such as custom fields and reports, and the ability to create automated workflows.

    \item Marketing automation: A CRM tool should be able to automate marketing activities, such as email campaigns and social media posts, based on customer preferences.

    \item Sales management: A CRM tool should be able to manage sales activities, such as tracking their sales pipeline, setting up reminders for follow-ups, and forecasting revenue.

    \item Customer service and support: A CRM tool should have a customer service and support module that helps manage customer problems and provide timely resolutions.

    \item Integration with other tools: A CRM tool should be able to integrate with other tools used by an organization, such as email marketing software, accounting software, and project management tools.

    \item Reporting and analytics: A CRM tool should provide reporting and analytics capabilities that enable users to monitor their sales and marketing performance.
\end{itemize}


\section{Specification Booklet to our Study Case}

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

    \item The CRM must be open-source.
    \item Customizability - The CRM should be easily customizable so that it can meet the specific needs of the University of Aveiro. This might include adding custom fields, modifying existing workflows, and integrating with other software systems used by the university.
    \item Accessibility - The CRM should be easy to access and use for staff members, with an intuitive user interface that can be quickly learned and navigated.
    \item Security - Given the sensitive nature of student data, your CRM should be secure and include features such as access control, encryption, and regular data backups. The CRM should make the integration with an IdP possible, in this case, UA's IdP.
    \item Reporting and analytics - The CRM should be capable of generating reports and analytics that can provide insights into student and faculty behavior, as well as trends and patterns that can inform decision-making.
    \item Integration with existing systems - The CRM should be able to integrate with other systems used by the university, such as student information systems (e.g. PACO), email platforms, and learning management systems (e.g. eLearning).
    \item Support and community - The CRM should have an active community of developers and users who can provide support and guidance, as well as regular updates and improvements to the software.
    \item Availability - The CRM should be available 24/7, with fault tolerance and minimal downtime.
    \item Scalability - The CRM should support automatic scaling, thus being able to withstand a high volume of requests.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Manage and maintain detailed contact information for all current, future, and past students, faculty, and staff.
    \item Track and manage all interactions with students, faculty, and staff, including emails, phone calls, meetings, and events.
    \item Send targeted email campaigns and track engagement metrics, as well as manage social media and digital advertising.
    \item Ability to generate reports and dashboards that provide insights into student and faculty behavior, as well as trends and patterns that can inform decision-making.
    \item Integration with student information systems: Ability to integrate with existing student information systems to import and export data, as well as to avoid duplicate data entry.
    \item Ability to access the CRM system from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
    \item Ability to automate routine tasks and workflows, such as scheduling reminders and follow-ups. 
    \item Ability to customize fields, forms, and workflows to meet the unique needs of the university. For instance, the CRM could have a workflow to post news on the University of Aveiro's website or to request a student's enrollment certificate.
    \item Ability to communicate with other institutions' CRMs, facilitating the communication between them, this could, for example, boost the process of a student's transfer between institutions.
    \item Ability to integrate with an AI service (e.g. bot), to simulate the interaction with a student, decreasing the need of having to call a staff member whenever a situation is simple enough so that the system can help the student.
