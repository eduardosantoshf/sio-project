\section{Introductory Note}

\section{Application Context of the University of Aveiro}

University of Aveiro has multiple data sources spread among different platforms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item SIGACAD - Academic Management System
    \item SIGEF - Financial Management System
    \item RHumo - Integrated Human Resources Management System
    \item PACO - Academic Portal
    \item RIA - Institutional repository
    \item etc.
\end{itemize}

With that in mind, the challenge is to carefully choose an open-source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to consolidate and organize all the disparate platforms.

Students frequently need to utilize these platforms to address various issues or challenges that they may be facing. For instance, a student may require adjustments to their tuition fees due to part-time work commitments, resulting in an inability to attend all classes. In such cases, the student must first modify their academic plan and subsequently adjust their payment plan. This can prove to be a confusing and difficult task, as it needs the use of multiple platforms, and most of the time, other services remain unaware of the student's current situation.

This is a brief example of a scenario that demands the use of multiple services, which could be streamlined and enhanced significantly through the implementation of a CRM system. A well-implemented CRM system would enable the University of Aveiro to efficiently manage the students' situations and promptly address their needs.
